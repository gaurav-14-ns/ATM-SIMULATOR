# ATM-SIMULATOR
This is a very basic ATM Simulator GUI (Graphical User Interface) which includes tools - Python and MySQL.

Here the user gets to either login or register or exit as an option. 
In the login section, the user input gets checked in the database.
If user login credentials matched then the user gets to access the following features - 
1. Balance Check
2. Cash Deposit
3. Cash Withdraw
4. View Transaction

And if login user not found then a popup appears as "User not found" and if the user inputs are invalid then popup appears stating invalid input.

In the registration section, user duplication has been taken care of, i.e., no user can be registered with the same mobile number.
